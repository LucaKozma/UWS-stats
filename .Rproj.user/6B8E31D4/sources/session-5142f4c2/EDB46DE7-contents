# Overview

This website is a collection of quizzes and exercises that you can use to revise the materials covered in your statistics classes (L7 Introduction to Psychology B, L8 Quantitative Research Skills, L9 Applying Psychology Methods, L11 Research Methods). 

# How to use it?

Each main statistical analysis has its own separate tab at the top of the page. When navigating there, you will see different types of questions: multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, true or false. Select the correct answers for each question - you should get immediate feedback telling you whether your answer was correct or not.
